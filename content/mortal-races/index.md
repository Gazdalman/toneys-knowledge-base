# The Mortal Races of Kaelenor

In the dawn ages, the newly manifested Embodiments performed their first great act upon the undifferentiated mortals who gave them form: the Great Diversification. Choosing from among these first people, the gods reshaped them, infusing them with their own essence and purpose. From this cataclysmic and creative event, the original mortal races were born: the adaptable **Humans**, the stoic **Dwarves**, the inventive **Gnomes**, the graceful **Elves**, the oceanic **Merfolk**, and the divine **Celestials**. These races formed the foundation of civilization and spread across the burgeoning world.

Millennia later, the world was irrevocably changed once more when the seal on aethereal energy was broken. The wild, untamed magic that flooded Kaelenor acted as a new crucible of creation, forging new peoples through violent and unpredictable means. These newer races were not born from the direct hand of a god, but from the raw, chaotic power of magic itself interacting with the existing life on the planet. They now walk the world alongside the elder races, carving out their own powerful legacies.
