title: Goliaths, The Giants' Kin
---
### The Awoken Giants

Goliaths were born when the Aether released from its seal transformed some of the giants that roamed the world. They lost a large portion of their height, but gained a mortal soul and deeper intellect. They typically stand between 10 to 15 ft but otherwise look like stocky humans. They aren't as numerous as some of the other races but make up for it by just how long lived they are. Most Goliaths follow the paths of nature, usually learning the druidic arts from a young age.

#### Primary Features
 - **Lifespan** - Between 1000 and 1500 years
 - **Language (Giant)** - Goliaths still speak in a modified version of their original language. Giants aren't considered intelligent creatures but they did have a rudimentary language comprised of grunts and groans. Goliaths added more sounds and inflections to increase the nuance of the language. That being said, they typically revert to the simplified version when talking to their larger cousins.
 - **Primary Deities** - Kord, Cernun, [[the-embodiments#Terra, The Stone Mother|Terra]], Cryos
#### Major Communities
- **Kael-Dun** - As one of the only TRUE Goliath cities, as most others are typically built within the hollowed out trunks of ancient trees or dug into mountains, Kael-Dun serves as a hub on the continent of Falthaan. It is the most culturally and racially diverse city in all of Falthaan. It's also home to the most well-respected school for the druidic arts in all of Kaelenor.
- **Nok-Thul** - Literally translating to "Death-Cold", this settlement in the frigid lands of Frostfell is home to the violent Goliath clan, Clan Makarok. They are the most infamous clan as they serve the Crowned Royal Dragon of Frost, JÃ¶kull, and their Chieftain, Dhor Makar, killed Queen Brynja's entire family.

### Goliath Subspecies

#### Common Goliath

This is the majority of Goliaths found across the world. This encompasses Goliaths who are descended from mountain, hill, or cave giants.

- **Appearance** - Common Goliaths are towering and powerfully built, though their exact appearance varies with their environment. Their stone-like skin ranges from the pale grey of granite to the dark hue of basalt, and the patterns on their skin can be bold and dark or faint and swirling. While most males are bald by tradition, some choose to keep their dark hair and women rarely cut it off entirely. Their builds can range from exceptionally stocky to slightly more lean.
- **Society** - The heart of Common Goliath society is a deep, druidic reverence for the natural world. Shaped by lifespans that span over a millennium, their culture is patient and deliberate, with elders revered as living libraries of ancient wisdom. Their laws are the laws of nature itself. This includes balance, growth, and decay. Most clans take on the role of stewards for the land they inhabit. They also carry the unique burden of being "Giant-Tenders." Using their shared, rudimentary language, they work to pacify their monstrous, unintelligent cousins, redirecting rampages and acting as mediators between the destructive force of the giants and the wider world.
- **Habitat** - Common Goliaths establish permanent settlements by integrating them into the surrounding nature. Their homes are often hollowed-out, magically-preserved ancient trees, or naturally formed, expanded cave networks. Their one major city, **Kael-Dun**, is the exception, serving as a cultural and spiritual hub for all Common Goliaths
#### Frost Giant Goliath

A rugged and brutal version of the goliath race, the Frost Giant Goliaths were forged by the raw essence of Frost Giants and have fully embraced the merciless nature of their frozen home.

- **Appearance** - Their skin is pale, often with hues of icy blue or stark white that resembles glacial ice. Their skin patterns are jagged and sharp, like patterns of frost on a rock face. They are exceptionally large and hardy, even for Goliaths, with thick builds designed for survival in the extreme cold.
- **Society** - The society of Frost Giant Goliaths is a brutal reflection of their environment. Any druidic traditions they once held have been twisted into a zealous worship of nature's most destructive aspects such as the killing cold, the fury of the blizzard, and the strength of the apex predator. Their culture is a stark meritocracy of might, where chieftains rule through fear and violence. Unlike their common kin who act as tenders, Frost Giant Goliaths view the giants of their lands as tools of war, beasts to be broken and unleashed upon their enemies. This relentless pursuit of power often leads the most ambitious clans to serve even greater predators, seeing allegiance with such beings as the ultimate expression of dominance.
- **Habitat** - Frost Giant Goliaths claim the most defensible locations on the frozen continent of Frostfell. Their settlements are permanent fortresses carved from glacial ice and the frozen sides of mountains. From these grim holds, they exert their brutal control over the surrounding tundra.
