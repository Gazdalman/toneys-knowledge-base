# The Hierarchy of Hell
## The Mother and Her Offspring
---
When the new universe was created by the embodiments after the God War, the memory of the betrayal of the Embodiment of fire, Flamma, was still in the back of everyone's minds. So, when it turned out that making a universe is harder than it seems and there were realms created for each of the embodiments without their want or consent, the realm of fire was a LITERAL hellscape. Eventually the realms each settled into their own plane and weren't all collected in one big realm party. But when things started crawling out of Hell, things got weird.

#### Archdevil of Wrath
- **True Name** - Zariel
- **Domain** - Wrath, Rage, Destruction, War
- **Appearance** - Zariel is a celestial with long black hair that is as dark as Umbra's deepest voids. She has two black-feathered wings with a celestial halo that burns with a crimson red flame. She typically wears a black dress and black lipstick which contrast her snow-white skin.
- **Personality** - Unlike the other Archdevils, whose personalities come from their domain, Zariel was always an angry, battle hungry, killing machine. She just got tired of killing demons. She faked her own death during the First Crusade into Hell and then swore allegiance to the Mother. For her allegiance and acting as a spy in Heaven for years before the crusade, the Mother awarded her the domain of Wrath that was abandoned by Satan who was now acting as the reluctant God of War, Theron. She is also cruel and indifferent to the lives of every being in existence, including the son she had with [[demigods#Alaric, The Demi-God King|King Alaric]] named Damien.
- **Holy Opposite** - Bezimel, Archon of Patience
