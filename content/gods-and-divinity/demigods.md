# The Demi-Gods
## The Children of the Divine
---
Demi-Gods are what happens when the divine get a bit too comfortable with mortals. While it is fairly commonplace these days, there was a time when a Demi-God was unheard of. After the Demi-God Accords, a meeting of the divine council to arbitrate what would happen with these children, it was decided that the divine parent could allow their children to ascend to godhood within their domain or find a more suitable domain. 


#### Alaric, The Demi-God King
- **Divine Parentage** - He is the son of the Goddess of Humanity, Alma, and the human king of Valora, Alistair. He was the second Demi-God ever born.
- **Appearance** - Alaric has his father's long black wavy hair. He has pale, olive skin with thoughtful, quiet eyes. He was slender before becoming king but became more toned and muscular thanks to his training and his combat experience. He typically wears the red and silver kings' garments of the royal family of Valora. During combat, he wears armor of the same color with the royal sigil, a sword entwined by two wyrms.
- **Personality** - Alaric is a scholarly man with wisdom beyond his years. He took the throne of Valora after the passing of his father, King Alistair, of old age. Though he is a Demi-God and king of the largest human kingdom in all of Kaelenor, he never views himself as above anyone, even refusing to ascend to godhood so that he may continue to guide his kingdom directly. He is kind to the point of marrying multiple queens to avoid sending anyone home without the political marriage they were looking for, but also ruthlessly efficient when it comes to wielding his sword for those he has sworn to protect. He holds a distinct hatred for the archdevil, [[hierarchy-of-hell#Archdevil of Wrath|Zariel]], a celestial turned devil who used him to produce a Demi-God that she then killed in front of him.
- **Divine Magic** - While he has no explicit divine abilities, Alaric can use his divine nature to access the skills and memories of all his ancestors, making him one of the most skilled warriors in human history.
- **Fun Fact** - Alaric has 11 children. While they were young, he consistently made time for each and every one of them during the day and still managed to fulfill his kingly duties. He always made sure to take a couple on any trips he had to take. It's really no wonder the [[reigning-deities#Amenodaea, The Soul's Desire|Goddess of Love]] is one of the mothers.
- **Likes** - Human history, Kaelen, elven architecture, dwarven craftsmanship, violin
- **Dislikes** - Zariel
