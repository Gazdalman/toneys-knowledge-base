# The Reigning Deities
## The Guardians of Mortal Reality
___
The Reigning Deities are mortals who have ascended to godhood by personifying an aspect of mortal life. This includes abstract concepts like love, justice, and secrets and even the mortal races. As such, they tend to look like their mortal self with some features that show their divine nature. 

### The Gods of the Mortal Races

#### Boric, The Mountain's Heart
- **Domain** - Dwarves, Dwarven Endurance, Dwarven Spirit
- **Alignment** - Lawful Neutral
- **Aegis** - A young dwarven stonemason who has never once set foot outside his mountain home.
- **Appearance** - A very stocky dwarf whose beard is braided with granite beads, meant to represent the eyes of [[the-embodiments#Terra, The Stone Mother|Terra]], and has calloused knuckles as hard as rock. He is bald and has eyes of a rich caramel. A faint, earthy scent surrounds him, like a deep cave after a rain. 
- **Divine Magic**
	- **Minor Blessing (Stone Sense)** - Boric can bestow his dwarves or any other devout miner with an intuitive sense of where they can find ore veins or precious stones so long as they offer a prayer before beginning the day's work.
