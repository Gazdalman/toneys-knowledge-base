# The Reigning Deities
## The Guardians of Mortal Reality
___
The Reigning Deities are mortals who have ascended to godhood by personifying an aspect of mortal life. This includes abstract concepts like love, justice, and secrets and even the mortal races. As such, they tend to look like their mortal self with some features that show their divine nature. 

### The Gods of the Mortal Races

#### Boric, The Mountain's Heart
- **Domain** - Dwarves, Dwarven Endurance, Dwarven Spirit
- **Alignment** - Lawful Neutral
- **Aegis** - A young dwarven stonemason who has never once set foot outside his mountain home.
- **Predecessor** - Adaman who was slain in the God War before the Unraveling.
- **Appearance** - A very stocky dwarf whose beard is braided with granite beads, meant to represent the eyes of [[the-embodiments#Terra, The Stone Mother|Terra]], and has calloused knuckles as hard as rock. He is bald and has eyes of a rich caramel. A faint, earthy scent surrounds him, like a deep cave after a rain. 
- **Divine Magic**
	- **Minor Blessing (Stone Sense)** - Boric can bestow his dwarves or any other devout miner with an intuitive sense of where they can find ore veins or precious stones so long as they offer a prayer before beginning the day's work.
	- **Divine Art (The Weight of the Mountain)** - Boric can temporarily imbue a person, object, or even a building with the conceptual weight and immovability of a mountain. For the duration of the spell, the target cannot be moved, damaged, or altered by any force.**
- **Fun Fact** - Boric believes that a well made ale is the solution to at least 60% of all mortal conflicts.
- **Personality** - Boric is typically calm and well spoken. He is almost always the voice of reason and can find common ground where there is some to be had. None of that matters if you get him drunk. Boric becomes a boisterous, jolly party animal if you get enough ale in him. But be warned, as he has no problem immediately challenging you to a good wrestle.
- **Likes** - Loyalty, tradition, well crafted goods, honesty, the deep places of the world
- **Dislikes** - Frivolity, broken oaths, hasty decisions, poor craftsmanship

### The Gods of the Mortal Concepts

#### Amenodaea, The Soul's Desire
- **Domain** - Love, Passion, Partnership, Romance
- **Alignment** - Chaotic Good
- **Aegis** - Vendalin's daughter, Calyopi for no other reason than she was an *adorable* baby. 
- **Appearance** - A beautiful human woman with warm, amber skin and hair that seems to be woven from the finest threads of crimson silk. Her eyes are a deep, empathetic brown and her touch can soothe a broken heart. She often has a garland of red roses in her hair.
- **Divine Magic**
	- **Minor Blessing (The Trysting Rose)** - Amenodaea can create a magic rose. This perfectly beautiful rose can be given to someone so that both people may feel the emotions of the other for an hour, developing empathy and understanding.
	- **Awakening (The Heart's Thorn)** - If Amenodaea usually represents the joy and good of love, this form represents everything but. Amenodaea can shift forms, becoming the goddess of possessiveness, jealousy, and heartbreak. It amplifies her power by a lot but has the downside of being emotionally devastating for her. In this form, her hair becomes white, her clothing becomes black, her eyes glow a dull purple, and vines with black roses and thorns that drip poison grow from her body. Being in this form is painfully heartbreaking for her and actively poisons the very concept of love if she maintains it for too long.
	- **Divine Art (The Heartbond)** - Amenodaea can forge a "heartbond" between two willing individuals. This bond links their souls, allowing them to share their strength, feel each other's pain, and communicate telepathically. The bond is a powerful blessing but also a great vulnerability, as the death of one partner can shatter the soul of the other.
- **Worshippers** - Lovers, bards, poets, young people hoping for a partner, and married couples praying for a long and happy life together.
- **Fun Fact** - Amenodaea is a terrible poet but believes her heartfelt, clumsy verses are more romantic than any epic. [[demigods#Alaric, The Demi-God King|Alaric]] would agree.
- **Personality** - Amenodaea is a sweet and fun loving person. She is prone to teasing, especially with her fellow goddess, friend, and mother-in-law, Arma, but is always comforting when the need arises. She typically floats when in a good mood and walks when she isn't feeling like her usual happy self. This changes when she is in her awakened mode. Normally, Amenodaea is a pacifist and fights only to get away. While awakened, she is cold, sadistic, and spiteful in battle and won't hesitate to kill, maim, or torture whoever her bitterness and sorrow is targeted at. Because of her concept being so integral to mortal reality, so much so that the very act of love and partnership of mortal beings act as a prayer for her, it is agreed that if she were to fundamentally change her stance on violence, or if her awakened form weren't so toxic to her domain, she would easily be on par with the Embodiments in terms of raw power.
- **Likes** - True love, grand romantic gestures, poetry, weddings, happy couples, Arma
- **Dislikes** - Infidelity, loveless relationships, cynicism, loneliness, [[hierarchy-of-hell#Archdevil of Wrath|Zariel]]
