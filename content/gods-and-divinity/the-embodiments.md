# The Embodiments
## The Foundational Principles
---
The Embodiments are manifestations of the integral pieces of reality. They existed as abstract constructs until the mortals gained consciousness and "observed" them. They stand taller than giants and have appearances that reflect their domain. They are the most powerful of the divine figures and require no worship to maintain their powers. However, this comes at a cost. Should one of them bite it without being replaced immediately, reality could unravel.

#### Terra, The Stone Mother

> "I don't know if you are ready to become a goddess, but your father wasn't ready to become king. So will you take the chance like him, or will you remain questioning yourself?" - Terra to Alamys when announcing her as her successor.


- **Domain** - Earth, Stone, Solidity, Terrain
- **Appearance** - Terra appears as a muscular, broad shouldered woman with skin the color of rich soil. Her hair is a weave of gravel and colorful geodes. Her eyes are the color of granite with a glitter or precious gems. Her voice has the undertone of shifting tectonic plates.
- **Birth** - Terra was born as the first mortals awoke on hard stone. They observed the dirt and soil around them and a distant mountain stood up. They named her Terra and she taught them magic to shape the earth and stone around them to make shelter.
- **Aegis**: Andabrant, an old dwarf said to be strong enough to rip rocks from a mountain side.
- **Divine Spells**
	- **Doomsday Spell (Unraveling)** - Triggers the dissolution of all solid matter in the universe, turning planets, mountains, and bodies into frictionless sea of particles.
	- **Spell of Creation (The Seed of Substances)** - Provided the raw, physical matter from which the new universe was formed.
- **Worshippers** - Farmers, miners, architects, and stonemasons. Dwarves hold special reverence for her as she shaped the [[reigning-deities#Boric, The Mountain's Heart|first dwarves]] from the first mortals.
- **Divine Artifact (Heart of the Mountain)** - A pale stone made of Terra's condensed essence. It can be used to manipulate the terrain such as flattening hills, opening canyons, or literally making a mountain out of a molehill. The last time this was seen in history was after the king of the Dwarven kingdom of Vaolek, King Mork the Lesser, used it to flatten mountain base of rebels after he was beaten by the leader. It was said that he was buried with the stone but no one remembers where he was buried.
- **Personality** - Terra is typically nonchalant about all matters that don't involve the stone and soil of the world but one. Amalys, her student and the demi-god daughter of [[demigods#Alaric, The Demi-God King|King Alaric of Valora]] and the Warrior Chieftainess of the Stone-Hide Clan. She is highly protective of Alamys and entrusted her with the title of Lesser Goddess of Earth, making her only second to Andabrant in the domain's hierarchy.
- **Fun Fact** - Terra will occasionally attune to dwarven mines as she finds the sounds of their pickaxes soothing.
